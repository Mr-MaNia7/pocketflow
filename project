This project is about building a sophisticated AI-powered research and analysis system with the following key components:

1. **Core Purpose**:

- It's designed to handle complex research queries (like analyzing quantum computing's impact on cybersecurity)
- The system breaks down these complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
- It combines multiple AI agents to perform different aspects of the research

2. **Main Components**:

- A planner node that decomposes complex queries
- Specialized agent nodes for:
  - Web research
  - Data analysis
  - Visualization
  - Code execution
  - Reporter
  - Supervisor
- Human-in-the-loop (HITL) validation
- Tool integrations for web search, code execution, and visualization

3. **Example Workflow**:
   The system follows a specific flow for research tasks:
1. User submits complex research query through the Next.js frontend
1. Planner node decomposes query into subtasks using LangGraph
1. Web research agent gathers relevant information from multiple sources
1. Data analysis agent processes and synthesizes gathered information
1. Visualization agent creates charts and diagrams using integrated tools
1. Code execution agent develops and runs relevant algorithms
1. Human-in-the-loop validation reviews and approves results
1. Reporter agent generates final comprehensive output
1. Supervisor agent monitors overall workflow progress

The project appears to be a system that combines AI agents with human oversight to perform complex research and analysis tasks, with a particular focus on making the process transparent and interactive through a modern web interface.
